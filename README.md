# LogisticRegression
Classification using Logistic Regression
This project is used to perform classification using Logistic Regression in python. In this project, a logistic regressor is used to classifying using pre-computed data from the images of a fine needle aspirate(FNA) cells of a breast mass into Benign(class 0) and Malignant(class 1) in this two class problem. The project includes a logistic regression algorithm to validate and test the given dataset and compute accuracy, recall and precision using confusion matrix for the same. Various plots explaining the learning process are included in this project.
